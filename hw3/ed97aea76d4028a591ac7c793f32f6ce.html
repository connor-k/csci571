        <h4>Template Notes.</h4>
        <p>
        I have been a web developer for the past 13 years. I enjoy what I do, and so on occasion I like to create new designs and offer them for free to the public. When I got started many years ago, I always found that looking at other designers work was one of the best ways to learn proper development. So this is my way of giving back. Use this template however you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
        The main image can be changed by either replacing the current image with another one of the same size (900x402), or using a new one of what ever dimensions you'd like. If you choose the latter, you must open up style.css and change the dimensions of #mainpic, as well as the file name if that is different.
        </p>

        I decided to leave the content portion open for the templates users to do as they with with a blank canvas. I don't like to restrict my users to much, and for that reason I leave defining of any content related styles to you. <a href="#">This is what a normal links look like</a>.
